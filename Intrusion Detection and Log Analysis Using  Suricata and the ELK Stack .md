## 1 Introduction

### 1.1 Background
In todayâ€™s cybersecurity landscape, organizations face increasing threats like unauthorized access, brute-force login attempts, and data exfiltration. Without the right monitoring and analysis tools, these attacks often go undetected. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) such as Suricata detect malicious activity in real-time by inspecting network traffic against a set of predefined rules. However, managing raw alert data at scale is difficult. The ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) addresses this by collecting, indexing, and visualizing logs in a human-readable format. When used together, these tools create an efficient and scalable Network Security Monitoring (NSM) solution.

### 1.2 Motivation
The main motivation for this project was to gain hands-on experience with industry-standard cybersecurity tools. As part of the Certified Information Cyber Security Analyst (CICSA) course, the goal was to understand how real-time traffic inspection works, detect attacks like brute force login attempts, and visualize threats for better incident response. The project aimed to replicate the functionality of a Security Operations Center (SOC) using open-source tools and simulated attacks.

### 1.3 Objectives

- Install and configure Suricata IDS on a Ubuntu system to monitor incoming network traffic.
- Simulate an SSH brute-force attack using Hydra to create real-world detection scenarios.
- Create a custom Suricata rule to trigger alerts for repeated failed SSH login attempts.
- Use Filebeat and Logstash to collect and process Suricata-generated logs.
- Visualize detected attacks in Kibana with real-time dashboards.
- Gain hands-on experience with the ELK Stack for log management and analysis.
- Understand the workflow of a SOC in detecting and analyzing security incidents.

## 2 Environment and Tools

<img width="564" height="311" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/620d65c3-d1e4-4ce2-a84e-bdb622b17b7c" />

Suricata is a powerful, open-source network threat detection engine that functions as both an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) and an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS). It is a high-performance tool widely adopted by both private and public organizations.

In simple terms, Suricata is like a digital security guard for computer networks. It carefully watches the traffic moving through the network, looking for any signs of suspicious or harmful activity. It helps keep the network safe by identifying and alerting to potential threats, making it a valuable tool for protecting digital assets.

### 2.2.2 Working of Suricata

<img width="709" height="291" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/584b4a9c-db1a-49b8-b1d2-86e696b8ded1" />

Suricata monitors network traffic using **signature-based** and **anomaly-based** detection methods. It can generate alerts and logs for system administrators and block threats when running in **IPS mode**.

**Key Features:**

- **Packet Capture & Decoding**: Captures network packets and decodes their content to understand communication protocols.
- **Signature-Based Detection**: Identifies known threats by comparing traffic against a database of malicious patterns (like antivirus software).
- **Anomaly-Based Detection**: Detects unknown or emerging threats by identifying deviations from normal network behavior.
- **Logging & Alerting**: Generates detailed logs and alerts for administrators when suspicious activity is found.
- **Blocking (IPS Mode)**: In IPS mode, Suricata can actively block malicious traffic in real-time.
- **Deployment Flexibility**: Can be deployed at various network pointsâ€”perimeter, internal segments, or cloud-based.
- **Configurable Rule Sets**: Detection and response capabilities are customizable through rule sets.
- **Regular Updates**: Requires frequent updates to stay effective against evolving threats.
